# Module 3 Assignment: Policy Management System

This project includes five key files that together make up a policy management system for an insurance company.

## File Descriptions:
1. `policyholder.py`: This file contains Policyholder class which handles all policyholder details
2. `product.py`: The file contains Product class which contains the insurance products offered by the company.
3. `payment.py`: The file defines the Payment class which deals with payment processing including sending reminders and managing late payments and penalties.
4. `main.py`: This is a demonstration file showcasing how the three classes above accomplishes their tasks.
5. `README.md`: This readme file

## Overview:
- This project is a simple Policy Management System developed for insurance companies that helps policy managers with everyday tasks like adding or suspending policyholders, registering new members, and managing various insurance products. 
- The system also makes payment processing easy and can automatically send reminders to policyholders when payments are due.

## Features:
1. Policyholder management class for adding, suspending or reactivating policyholders.
2. Product management class for creating, updating, or suspending insurance products.
3. Payment management class that helps in payments processing, sending payments reminders and applying penalties to late payments.
4. System demonstration program helps demonstrating the functionalities of the above three classes by creating two policyholders, registering them with different products and then process their payments.

## Prerequisites:
- Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can check if Python is installed (and verify the version) by running the following command in your terminal (e.g., Windows Command Prompt or Windows PowerShell in Windows environments):
   - `python --version`
- You can also open windows start menu and search IDLE or Python. If you see IDLE as an installed program, then you are sure that a Python is installed in your machine.
- Kindly make sure that you have Python 3 installed in you computer as some of the features in this program is based on Python 3.

## Installation Steps:
1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Extract the ZIP file (if downloaded).
3. Ensure that the following files are in the same directory:
   - `policyholder.py`
   - `product.py`
   - `payment.py`
   - `main.py`
   - `README.md`

## Running the Project:
To run the project, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the folder containing the files.
2. Run the following command in your terminal:
   - `python main.py`
   - Alternatively, you can open the `main.py` file in a Python IDE (such as the built-in IDLE), and run the module (keyboard shorcut is F5 in Microsoft Windows).

## Once the project runs, the system will:
- Create two policyholders.
- Register them for an insurance product.
- Process their payments.
- Display their account details.
