# Module 3 Assignment: Policy Management System

This project includes five key files that together make up a simple yet functional Policy Management System for an insurance company.

## File Descriptions:
1. `policyholder.py`: This file contains the Policyholder class, which handles all details related to policyholders, including their status (active, suspended, etc.).
2. `product.py`: Defines the Product class, which outlines the insurance products offered.
3. `payment.py`: Contains the Payment class, responsible for processing payments, sending reminders, and managing penalties for late payments.
4. `main.py`: Demonstrates how the system works by creating policyholders, registering them for insurance products, processing payments, and displaying account information.
5. `README.md`: This readme file

## Overview:
- This project serves as a basic Policy Management System designed for insurance companies. It helps policy managers handle tasks like adding or suspending policyholders, registering new members, and managing different insurance products. The system also processes payments and can send reminders to policyholders when payments are due.

## Features:
1. Policyholder Management: Add, suspend, or reactivate policyholders.
2. Product Management: Create, update, or suspend insurance products.
3. Payment Management: Process payments, send payment reminders, and apply late payment penalties.
4. System Demonstration: The system demonstrates its functionality by creating two policyholders, registering them for a product, and processing their payments.

## Prerequisites:
Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can check if itâ€™s installed and verify the version by running the following command in your terminal (e.g., Command Prompt or Windows PowerShell):
- `python --version`

## Installation Steps:
1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Extract the ZIP file (if downloaded).
3. Ensure that the following files are in the same directory:
   - `policyholder.py`
   - `product.py`
   - `payment.py`
   - `main.py`
   - `README.md`

## Running the Project:
To run the project, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the folder containing the files.
2. Run the following command in your terminal:
- `python main.py`
- Alternatively, you can open the `main.py` file in a Python IDE (such as the built-in IDLE), and run the module by pressing F5.

Once the project runs, the system will:
- Create two policyholders.
- Register them for an insurance product.
- Process their payments.
- Display their account details.
